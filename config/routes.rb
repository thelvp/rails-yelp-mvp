# -- USER STORIES
# [X] A visitor can see the list of all restaurants. - GET "restaurants"
# [X] A visitor can add a new restaurant, and be redirected to the show view of that new restaurant. - GET "restaurants/new" - POST "restaurants"
# [X] A visitor can add a new review to a restaurant - GET "restaurants/38/reviews/new" - POST "restaurants/38/reviews"
# [X] A visitor can see the details of a restaurant, with all the reviews related to the restaurant. - GET "restaurants/38"
# * Hint: to handle the route GET "restaurants/38/reviews/new", you will have to use nested resources. *

# Coding in Silo: Route/Controller/View
# Implement each user story separately! Start by writing the route (you can look at the routes above ðŸ˜‰), then coding the corresponding controller action and finally the view.
